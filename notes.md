- created folder & started with the article
- much of the basic stuff is familiar from working through Caleb's book
- noting syntax to build and run vs. just running 
	- build doesn't run & run doesn't build (?)
		- testing with run before build
			- not seeing anything in ```pkg/linux_amd64/golang.org```
		- ```go build``` put ```wiki``` in the working directory
			- still not seeing anything in ```pkg/linux_amd64/golang.org```
